Open questions and notes that don't belong in the public docs.

## Bundled polar data licence

airfoiltools.com publishes no terms of use: a privacy policy and a footer reading "Copyright © 2026 All Rights Reserved", but no licence for reuse. The polars in `src/data/airfoils.json` are its own XFOIL output and presumably fall under that notice. The UIUC Airfoil Coordinates Database is publicly available, but neither its database page nor its home page states terms or a licence.

The app is now public on GitHub Pages. Options:

- Ask airfoiltools.com (via its contact page) for permission to redistribute the polars.
- Regenerate the bundled polars ourselves with the same WebXFOIL build the app runs, from the UIUC coordinates. Removes the airfoiltools question; UIUC remains.

Background on where the bundled and computed polars differ: `docs/scope-xfoil-wasm.md`.

## Questions for Sam

From Sam's feedback on the structure editor (2026-10-16). Each needs his detail before it can be fixed.

1. **Manual rib spacing**: "issues filling out rib spacing in manual mode, similar to the behaviour the chord tool had". What goes wrong, and what did the chord tool do? Suspect: the rows re-sort by distance while you type, so the field being edited jumps.
2. **Gussets "seem to have random issues"**: which ribs, and what looks wrong? A saved project file that shows it would be ideal.
3. **Ribs clash with the TE in the rib diagrams**: which trailing-edge stock is set, and is it every rib or only towards the tip? Suspect: the TE notch doesn't follow the rib's actual depth or washout.
